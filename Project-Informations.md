Part 1 Introduction to React
In this part, we will familiarize ourselves with the React-library, which we will be using to write the code that runs in the browser. We will also look at some features of JavaScript that are important for understanding React.

a Introduction to React
b JavaScript
c Component state, event handlers
d A more complex state, debugging React apps

Part 2 Communicating with server
Let's continue our introduction to React. First, we will take a look at how to render a data collection, like a list of names, to the screen. After this, we will inspect how a user can submit data to a React application using HTML forms. Next, our focus shifts towards looking at how JavaScript code in the browser can fetch and handle data stored in a remote backend server. Lastly, we will take a quick look at a few simple ways of adding CSS styles to our React applications.

a Rendering a collection, modules
b Forms
c Getting data from server

Part 4 Testing Express servers, user administration
In this part, we will continue our work on the backend. Our first major theme will be writing unit and integration tests for the backend. After we have covered testing, we will take a look at implementing user authentication and authorization.

a Structure of backend application, introduction to testing
b Testing the backend
c User administration
d Token authentication

Projects/Exercises:
  - blog complete backend application


part 5 Testing React apps
In this part we return to the frontend, first looking at different possibilities for testing the React code. We will also implement token based authentication which will enable users to log in to our application.

a Login in frontend
b props.children and proptypes
c Testing React apps
d End to end testing
